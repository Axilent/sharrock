Sharrock
========

NOTE: NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME
------------------------------
Sharrock is in extremely early stages and might be completely broken.  Seriously, use at your own risk.  We'll take down this notice when it's semi-stable.


Sharrock is an easy declarative RPC framework.  It consists of the following parts.

*	A *function descriptor* syntax that provides information in both a machine and human readable format about the available functions a service provides, including details of acceptable parameters and return values.  The function descriptor also provides the basis for *automated API documentation*.
*	A *transport layer* that handles function calls and their return values.  The hope is that Sharrock will be able to use both REST and Protocol Buffers as transports.
*	*Serialization* of objects in both JSON and XML.  In addition serialization of function descriptors as human-readable HTML.
*	A *handler* framework for Django, providing hooks to integrate Sharrock into a django app.
*	A Python *RPC Client* for Sharrock, making it easy to build client code against a Sharrock service by using the function descriptors.
